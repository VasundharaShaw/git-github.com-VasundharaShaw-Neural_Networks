# Neural_Networks

This is a **learning repository** containing notebooks and scripts for building and understanding basic neural networks from scratch.

**Disclaimer:** I do **not** claim any rights to the core ideas or code structures implemented here. Much of the code is based on (or inspired by) the excellent *Neural Networks from Scratch* series by **Sentdex**.

## Contents
- `NeuralNets_0.ipynb` – Introduction to neural networks  
- `NeuralNets_1.ipynb` – Extending and experimenting with architectures  
- `digits_mlp1.ipynb` – Simple multilayer perceptron example (from a colleague; not my own work)  
- `data/MNIST/raw/` – Raw MNIST dataset files  

## ⚙️ Dependencies
To run the notebooks, install the following (Python ≥ 3.10 recommended):
