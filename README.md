# Neural_Networks

This is a **learning repository** containing notebooks and scripts for building and understanding basic neural networks from scratch.

## Contents
- `NeuralNets_0.ipynb` – Introduction to neural networks  
- `NeuralNets_1.ipynb` – Extending and experimenting with architectures  
- `digits_mlp1.ipynb` – Simple multilayer perceptron example. This is not mine but an example from a colleague. 
- `data/MNIST/raw/` – Raw MNIST dataset files  

## ⚙️ Dependencies
To run the notebooks, install the following (Python ≥ 3.10 recommended):

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn torch torchvision

git clone https://github.com/VasundharaShaw/git-github.com-VasundharaShaw-Neural_Networks.git
cd git-github.com-VasundharaShaw-Neural_Networks
jupyter notebook
